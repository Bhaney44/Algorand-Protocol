[Bounty](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/grow-algorand/issues/150) | [Issue](https://github.com/perawallet/connect/issues/32)

Project intended to create a simplified, easy, and secure web connection method for Pera Wallet.

# Problem

A major problem on the Algorand blockchain is the lack of scalable and secure open source code for connecting the perawallet to decentralized applications.
The problem with the existing solutions is that they use too much unnecesary code, which creates vulnerabilities and makes it difficult to use for open source development because the convolutions create difficulty for developers.

# Solution

The purpose for this project is to develop a simplified and scalable methodology for developing wallet connection mechanisms with Algorand applications.
